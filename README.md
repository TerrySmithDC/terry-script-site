# Terry Script website

I've been wanting to have a place to throw up stupid experiments for ages. By making this public I'm hoping it'll incentivize me to finish a site and actually throwing up my deep dives instead of procrastinating putting anything online and having it be lost to my hard drives. _knock on wood_

For the first bit I'm going to be setting up this site.

Currently the site is using the following:

- Tailwind
- 11ty
- Alpine.js
